Verse 1:
Walking down the empty street
Moonlight dancing at my feet
Every shadow tells a story
Of forgotten nights of glory

Chorus:
Take me back to yesterday
Where the music used to play
In the silence of the night
We'll be dancing till the light

Verse 2:
Memories like falling rain
Washing away all the pain
In your arms I found my home
Never felt so less alone

Chorus:
Take me back to yesterday
Where the music used to play
In the silence of the night
We'll be dancing till the light

Bridge:
Time stands still when you're around
Love is the only sound
Hearts beating as one tonight
Everything will be alright

Chorus:
Take me back to yesterday
Where the music used to play
In the silence of the night
We'll be dancing till the light
