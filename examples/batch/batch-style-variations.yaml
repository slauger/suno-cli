    Verse 1:
    Walking through the city lights
    Everything feels different tonight
    Music playing in my mind
    Leaving all my worries behind

    Chorus:
    This is my moment
    This is my time
    Dancing to the rhythm
    Of this life of mine

    Verse 2:
    Stars are shining up above
    Feeling grateful for this love
    Every step a new beginning
    Every breath a song worth singing

    Chorus:
    This is my moment
    This is my time
    Dancing to the rhythm
    Of this life of mine
