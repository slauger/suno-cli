# Batch generation with mixed output configurations
# Usage: suno batch batch-mixed-outputs.yaml
#
# This example shows how to use:
# - Global output_base in YAML
# - use_subdirectories setting
# - Per-song output directory overrides

# Global output directory
output_base: ./my-album

# Use subdirectories by default
use_subdirectories: true

songs:
  # Song 1: Uses global output_base + subdirectory
  - title: "Intro"
    prompt: |
      Welcome to the album
      Let's begin the journey
    style: "ambient, cinematic, 60 BPM"
    track: 1
    # Will be saved to: ./my-album/song_01/

  # Song 2: Custom subdirectory name
  - title: "Main Theme"
    prompt: |
      This is the heart of it all
      The song everyone knows
    style: "pop rock, anthemic, 130 BPM"
    track: 2
    output: main_theme
    # Will be saved to: ./my-album/main_theme/

  # Song 3: Uses global output_base + subdirectory
  - title: "Interlude"
    prompt: |
      A moment to breathe
      Before the next wave
    style: "downtempo, atmospheric, 85 BPM"
    track: 3
    # Will be saved to: ./my-album/song_03/

  # Song 4: Absolute path override (ignores output_base and use_subdirectories)
  - title: "Bonus Track"
    prompt: |
      A special addition
      Hidden treasure
    style: "experimental, electronic, 140 BPM"
    track: 99
    output: ./bonus/special
    # Will be saved to: ./bonus/special/
    # (absolute path overrides everything)

# Advanced tip: You can combine CLI and YAML settings
# CLI --output-base has priority over YAML output_base
#
# Example:
#   suno batch batch-mixed-outputs.yaml -o ./different-location
#   This will use ./different-location instead of ./my-album
