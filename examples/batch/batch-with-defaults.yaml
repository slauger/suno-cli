# Batch generation with defaults
# Usage: suno batch batch-with-defaults.yaml
#
# This example shows how to use the 'defaults' section to set
# common values for all songs. Individual songs can override any default.

# Global output directory
output_base: ./my-album-with-defaults

# Use subdirectories for each song
use_subdirectories: true

# Default values for all songs
# These can be overridden per song
# Available fields: lyrics, style, model, gender, artist, album, cover,
#                   generate_cover, instrumental, duration
defaults:
  style: "pop rock, energetic, 125 BPM"  # Default style for all songs
  model: V4_5ALL
  gender: male
  artist: "My Awesome Band"
  album: "Greatest Hits Vol. 1"
  cover: ./examples/cover-art.jpg  # Default cover for all songs
  generate_cover: false  # Don't generate AI covers (use default cover)
  instrumental: false

songs:
  # Song 1: Uses all defaults including style
  - title: "First Track"
    lyrics: |
      Verse 1:
      This is the first track
      Using all the defaults

      Chorus:
      Default values everywhere
      Makes it easy to declare
    track: 1
    # Will use: default style, male vocals, V4_5ALL model, default cover, "My Awesome Band" artist

  # Song 2: Override gender, model, and style
  - title: "Second Track"
    lyrics: |
      Verse 1:
      This one is different
      Female vocals and V5

      Chorus:
      Override when needed
      Flexibility is key
    style: "synth pop, dreamy, 110 BPM"  # Override default style
    track: 2
    gender: female  # Override default
    model: V5  # Override default
    # Still uses: default cover, "My Awesome Band" artist, etc.

  # Song 3: Custom cover, uses default style
  - title: "Third Track"
    lyrics: |
      Verse 1:
      Special song needs special art
      Custom cover for this part

      Chorus:
      Unique visuals
      Stand out from the rest
    track: 3
    cover: ./examples/special-cover.jpg  # Override default cover
    # Uses: default style, male vocals (default), V4_5ALL (default), "My Awesome Band" (default)

  # Song 4: Instrumental override with custom style
  - title: "Instrumental Break"
    lyrics: |
      [Instrumental section]
      Atmospheric sounds
      No vocals needed
    style: "ambient, atmospheric, 80 BPM"  # Override default style
    track: 4
    instrumental: true  # Override default (no vocals)
    # Uses: V4_5ALL (default), default cover, "My Awesome Band" (default)

  # Song 5: Different artist, custom style
  - title: "Featured Collaboration"
    lyrics: |
      Verse 1:
      Special guest on this one
      Collaboration has begun

      Chorus:
      Two artists unite
      Creating something bright
    style: "R&B, smooth, 95 BPM"  # Override default style
    track: 5
    artist: "My Awesome Band feat. Special Guest"  # Override default artist
    # Uses: male vocals (default), V4_5ALL (default), default cover

# Result:
# All songs get the same cover (unless overridden)
# All songs have same artist (unless overridden)
# All songs are on the same album
# Individual songs can override any setting as needed
#
# This saves a lot of repetition in the YAML file!
